This is a hopefully complete and mostly correct database of D&D 5e spells in a computer
readable format.  It was generated from https://github.com/SirIndubitable/dnd5eSpells-Generator

It may be a bit off in some places, as it was created by forking https://github.com/tadzik/5e-spells
then parsing https://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com to get the rest of the spells.

Please report any issues and discrepancies with the list

Enjoy!
